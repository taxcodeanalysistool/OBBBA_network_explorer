(2) Consultation .—Prior to making a determination under this subsection, the Secretary shall consult with the governing body of the county, city, town, or other jurisdiction or jurisdictions having primary taxing authority over the land or interest to be acquired as to the impacts of the proposed action. (3) Action to advance local public awareness .—The Secretary shall take such steps as the Secretary considers appropriate to advance local public awareness of the proposed action. (4) Administration of acquisitions .—Land, water, and interests in land or water acquired in accordance with this subsection shall be administered as part of the System unit to which they are added, subject to the laws and regulations applicable to the System unit. (5) When authority applies .—For the purposes of paragraph (1)(A), in all cases except the case of technical boundary changes (resulting from such causes as survey error or changed road alignments), the authority of the Secretary under paragraph (1)(A) shall apply only if each of the following conditions is met: (A) The sum of the total acreage of the land, water, and interests in land or water to be added to the System unit and the total acreage of the land, water, and interests in land or water to be deleted from the System unit is not more than 5 percent of the total Federal acreage authorized to be included in the System unit and is less than 200 acres. (B) The acquisition, if any, is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, as determined by the Secretary. (C) The sum of the total appraised value of the land, water, and interests in land or water to be added to the System unit and the total appraised value of the land, water, and interests in land or water to be deleted from the System unit does not exceed $750,000. (D) The proposed boundary change is not an element of a more comprehensive boundary change proposal. (E) The proposed boundary has been subject to a public review and comment period. (F) The Director obtains written consent for the boundary change from all property owners whose land, water, or interests in land or water, or a portion of whose land, water, or interests in land or water, will be added to or deleted from the System unit by the boundary change. (G) The land abuts other Federal land administered by the Director. (6) Act of congress required .—Minor boundary changes involving only deletions of acreage owned by the Federal Government and administered by the Service may be made only by Act of Congress. \\n\\n| Revised Section | Source (U.S. Code) | Source (Statutes at Large) |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| 100506(a) | 16 U.S.C. 1a–12. | Pub.

        "text": "In furtherance of the findings and policy stated in section 101912 of this title, and except as provided by this subchapter or otherwise authorized by law, the Secretary shall utilize concession contracts to authorize a person, corporation, or other entity to provide accommodations, facilities, and services to visitors to System units. Concession contracts shall be awarded as follows: (1) Competitive selection process .—Except as otherwise provided in this section, all proposed concession contracts shall be awarded by the Secretary to the person, corporation, or other entity submitting the best proposal, as determined by the Secretary through a competitive selection process. The competitive process shall include simplified procedures for small, individually-owned entities seeking award of a concession contract. (2) Solicitation of proposals .—Except as otherwise provided in this section, prior to awarding a new concession contract (including renewals or extensions of existing concession contracts) the Secretary— (A) shall publicly solicit proposals for the concession contract; and (B) in connection with the solicitation, shall— (i) prepare a prospectus and publish notice of its availability at least once in local or national newspapers or trade publications, by electronic means, or both, as appropriate; and (ii) make the prospectus available on request to all interested persons. (3) Information to be included in prospectus .—The prospectus shall include the following information: (A) The minimum requirements for the contract as set forth in paragraph (4). (B) The terms and conditions of any existing concession contract relating to the services and facilities to be provided, including all fees and other forms of compensation provided to the United States by the concessioner.

(E) An estimate of the amount of compensation due an existing concessioner from a new concessioner under the terms of a prior concession contract. (F) A statement as to the weight to be given to each selection factor identified in the prospectus and the relative importance of those factors in the selection process. (G) Other information related to the proposed concession operation that is provided to the Secretary pursuant to a concession contract or is otherwise available to the Secretary, as the Secretary determines is necessary to allow for the submission of competitive proposals. (H) Where applicable, a description of a preferential right to the renewal of the proposed concession contract held by an existing concessioner as set forth in paragraph (7). (4) Consideration of proposals.— (A) Minimum requirements .—No proposal shall be considered that fails to meet the minimum requirements as determined by the Secretary. The minimum requirements shall include the following: (i) The minimum acceptable franchise fee or other forms of consideration to the Federal Government. (ii) Any facilities, services, or capital investment required to be provided by the concessioner. (iii) Measures necessary to ensure the protection, conservation, and preservation of resources of the System unit. (B) Rejection of proposal .—The Secretary shall reject any proposal, regardless of the franchise fee offered, if the Secretary determines that— (i) the person, corporation, or entity is not qualified or is not likely to provide satisfactory service; or (ii) the proposal is not responsive to the objectives of protecting and preserving resources of the System unit and of providing necessary and appropriate facilities and services to the public at reasonable rates. (C) All proposals fail to meet mimimum 1 requirements or are rejected .—If all proposals submitted to the Secretary fail to meet the minimum requirements or are rejected by the Secretary, the Secretary shall establish new minimum contract requirements and re-initiate the competitive selection process pursuant to this section. (D) Terms and conditions materially amended or not incorporated in contract .—The Secretary may not execute a concession contract that materially amends or does not incorporate the proposed terms and conditions of the concession contract as set forth in the applicable prospectus. If proposed material amendments or changes are considered appropriate by the Secretary, the Secretary shall resolicit offers for the concession contract incorporating the material amendments or changes. (5) Selection of the best proposal.— (A) Factors in selection .—In selecting the best proposal, the Secretary shall consider the following principal factors: (i) The responsiveness of the proposal to the objectives of protecting, conserving, and preserving resources of the System unit and of providing necessary and appropriate facilities and services to the public at reasonable rates.

(iii) The financial capability of the person, corporation, or entity submitting the proposal. (iv) The proposed franchise fee, except that consideration of revenue to the United States shall be subordinate to the objectives of protecting, conserving, and preserving resources of the System unit and of providing necessary and appropriate facilities to the public at reasonable rates. (B) Secondary factors .—The Secretary may also consider such secondary factors as the Secretary considers appropriate. (C) Development of regulations .—In developing regulations to implement this subchapter, the Secretary shall consider the extent to which plans for employment of Indians (including Native Alaskans) and involvement of businesses owned by Indians, Indian tribes, or Native Alaskans in the operation of a concession contract should be identified as a factor in the selection of a best proposal under this section. (6) Congressional notification.— (A) In general .—The Secretary shall submit any proposed concession contract with anticipated annual gross receipts in excess of $5,000,000 or a duration of more than 10 years to the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate.

(B) Exception .—The Secretary shall grant a preferential right of renewal to an existing concessioner with respect to proposed renewals of the categories of concession contracts described by paragraph (8), subject to the requirements of that paragraph. (C) Entitlement to award of new contract .—A concessioner that successfully exercises a preferential right of renewal in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter shall be entitled to award of the proposed new concession contract to which the preference applies. (8) Outfitter and guide services and small contracts.— (A) Application .—Paragraph (7) shall apply only to the following: (i) Subject to subparagraph (B), concession contracts that solely authorize the provision of specialized backcountry outdoor recreation guide services that require the employment of specially trained and experienced guides to accompany System unit visitors in the backcountry so as to provide a safe and enjoyable experience for visitors who otherwise may not have the skills and equipment to engage in that activity. (ii) Subject to subparagraph (C), concession contracts with anticipated annual gross receipts under $500,000. (B) Outfitting and guide concessioners.— (i) Description .—Outfitting and guide concessioners, where otherwise qualified, include concessioners that provide guided river running, hunting, fishing, horseback, camping, and mountaineering experiences. (ii) When entitled to preferential right .—An outfitting and guide concessioner is entitled to a preferential right of renewal under this subchapter only if— (I) the contract with the outfitting and guide concessioner does not grant the concessioner any interest, including any leasehold surrender interest or possessory interest, in capital improvements on land owned by the United States within a System unit, other than a capital improvement constructed by a concessioner pursuant to the terms of a concession contract prior to November 13, 1998, or constructed or owned by a concessioner or the concessioner's predecessor before the subject land was incorporated into the System; (II) the Secretary determines that the concessioner has operated satisfactorily during the term of the contract (including any extension); and (III) the concessioner has submitted a responsive proposal for a proposed new concession contract that satisfies the minimum requirements established by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (4). (C) Contract with estimated gross receipts of less than $500,000 .—A concessioner that holds a concession contract that the Secretary estimates will result in gross annual receipts of less than $500,000 if renewed shall be entitled to a preferential right of renewal under this subchapter if— (i) the Secretary has determined that the concessioner has operated satisfactorily during the term of the contract (including any extension); and (ii) the concessioner has submitted a responsive proposal for a proposed new concession contract that satisfies the minimum requirements established by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (4). (9) New or additional services .—The Secretary may propose to amend the applicable terms of an existing concessions contract to provide new and additional services where the Secretary determines the services are necessary and appropriate for public use and enjoyment of the unit of the National Park System in which they are located and are consistent to the highest practicable degree with the preservation and conservation of the resources and values of the unit. Such new and additional services shall not represent a material change to the required and authorized services as set forth in the applicable prospectus or contract. (10) Authority of secretary not limited .—Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as limiting the authority of the Secretary to determine whether to issue a concession contract or to establish its terms and conditions in furtherance of the policies expressed in this subchapter. (11) Exceptions .—Notwithstanding this section, the Secretary may award, without public solicitation, the following: (A) Temporary contract .—To avoid interruption of services to the public at a System unit, the Secretary may award a temporary concession contract or an extension of an existing concessions contract for a term not to exceed 3 years, except that prior to making the award, the Secretary shall take all reasonable and appropriate steps to consider alternatives to avoid the interruption. (B) Contract in extraordinary circumstances .—The Secretary may award a concession contract in extraordinary circumstances where compelling and equitable considerations require the award of a concession contract to a particular party in the public interest. Award of a concession contract under this subparagraph shall not be made by the Secretary until at least 30 days after— (i) publication in the Federal Register of notice of the Secretary's intention to award the contract and the reasons for the action; and (ii) submission of notice to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives. \\n\\n| Revised Section | Source (U.S. Code) | Source (Statutes at Large) |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| 101913 | 16 U.S.C. 5952 (less (7)(C)). | Pub.

(2) Pledge as security .—A leasehold surrender interest may be pledged as security for financing of a capital improvement or the acquisition of a concession contract when approved by the Secretary pursuant to this subchapter. (3) Transfer and relinquishment or waiver of interest .—A leasehold surrender interest shall be transferred by the concessioner in connection with any transfer of the concession contract and may be relinquished or waived by the concessioner. (4) Limit on extinguishing or taking interest .—A leasehold surrender interest shall not be extinguished by the expiration or other termination of a concession contract and may not be taken for public use except on payment of just compensation. (5) Value of interest .—The value of a leasehold surrender interest in a capital improvement shall be an amount equal to the initial value (construction cost of the capital improvement), increased (or decreased) by the same percentage increase (or decrease) as the percentage increase (or decrease) in the Consumer Price Index, from the date of making the investment in the capital improvement by the concessioner to the date of payment of the value of the leasehold surrender interest, less depreciation of the capital improvement as evidenced by the condition and prospective serviceability in comparison with a new unit of like kind. (6) Value of interest in certain new concession contracts.— (A) How value is determined .—The Secretary may provide, in any new concession contract that the Secretary estimates will have a leasehold surrender interest of more than $10,000,000, that the value of any leasehold surrender interest in a capital improvement shall be based on— (i) a reduction on an annual basis, in equal portions, over the same number of years as the time period associated with the straight line depreciation of the initial value (construction cost of the capital improvement), as provided by applicable Federal income tax laws and regulations in effect on November 12, 1998; or (ii) an alternative formula that is consistent with the objectives of this subchapter. (B) When alternative formula may be used .—The Secretary may use an alternative formula under subparagraph (A)(ii) only if the Secretary determines, after scrutiny of the financial and other circumstances involved in the particular concession contract (including providing notice in the Federal Register and opportunity for comment), that the alternative formula is, compared to the standard method of determining value provided for in paragraph (5), necessary to provide a fair return to the Federal Government and to foster competition for the new contract by providing a reasonable opportunity to make a profit under the new contract. If no responsive offers are received in response to a solicitation that includes the alternative formula, the concession opportunity shall be resolicited with the leasehold surrender interest value as described in paragraph (5). (7) Increase in value of interest .—Where a concessioner, pursuant to the terms of a concession contract, makes a capital improvement to an existing capital improvement in which the concessioner has a leasehold surrender interest, the cost of the additional capital improvement shall be added to the then-current value of the concessioner's leasehold surrender interest.",

(2) Existing concessioner awarded a new contract .—A concessioner awarded a new concession contract to replace an existing concession contract after November 13, 1998, instead of directly receiving the possessory interest compensation, shall have a leasehold surrender interest in its existing possessory interest improvements under the terms of the new concession contract and shall carry over as the initial value of the leasehold surrender interest (instead of construction cost) an amount equal to the value of the existing possessory interest as of the termination date of the previous concession contract. In the event of a dispute between the concessioner and the Secretary as to the value of the possessory interest, the matter shall be resolved through binding arbitration. (3) New concessioner awarded a contract .—A new concessioner awarded a concession contract and required to pay a prior concessioner for possessory interest in prior improvements shall have a leasehold surrender interest in the prior improvements. The initial value in the leasehold surrender interest (instead of construction cost) shall be an amount equal to the value of the existing possessory interest as of the termination date of the previous concession contract. (4) De novo review of value determination .—If the Secretary, or either party to a value determination proceeding conducted under a Service concession contract issued before November 13, 1998, considers that the value determination decision issued pursuant to the proceeding misinterprets or misapplies relevant contractual requirements or their underlying legal authority, the Secretary or either party may seek, within 180 days after the date of the decision, de novo review of the value determination decision by the United States Court of Federal Claims. The Court of Federal Claims may make an order affirming, vacating, modifying or correcting the determination decision.",

(2) Acquisition of land or water.— (A) In general .—Under paragraph (1), the Secretary may provide financial assistance for a project for the acquisition of land, water, or an interest in land or water, or a wetland area or an interest in a wetland area, as identified in the wetlands provisions of the comprehensive plan (other than land, water, or an interest in land or water acquired from the United States for less than fair market value), but not including incidental costs relating to acquisition. (B) Retention of right of use and occupancy .—When a State provides that the owner of a single-family residence may, at the owner's option, elect to retain a right of use and occupancy for not less than 6 months after the date of acquisition of the residence and the owner elects to retain such a right— (i) the owner shall be deemed to have waived any benefits under sections 203 to 206 of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 4623 to 4626); and (ii) for the purposes of those sections the owner shall not be deemed to be a displaced person as defined in section 101 of that Act (42 U.S.C. 4601). (3) Development of basic outdoor recreation facilities .—Under paragraph (1), the Secretary may provide financial assistance for a project for development of basic outdoor recreation facilities to serve the general public, including the development of Federal land under lease to States for terms of 25 years or more. No assistance shall be available under this chapter to enclose or shelter a facility normally used for an outdoor recreation activity, but the Secretary may permit local funding, not to exceed 10 percent of the total amount allocated to a State in any one year, to be used for construction of a sheltered facility for a swimming pool or ice skating rink in an area where the Secretary determines that the construction is justified by the severity of climatic conditions and the increased public use made possible by the construction.",

The Secretary may make payments from time to time in keeping with the rate of progress toward the satisfactory completion of a project. The approval of all projects and all payments, or any commitments relating thereto, shall be withheld until the Secretary receives appropriate written assurance from the State that the State has the ability and intention to finance its share of the cost of all of the projects, and to operate and maintain by acceptable standards, at State expense, the properties or facilities acquired or developed for public outdoor recreation use. (2) Payment recipients .—Payments for all projects shall be made by the Secretary to the chief executive official of the State or to a State official or agency designated by the chief executive official or by State law having authority and responsibility to accept and to administer funds paid under this section for approved projects. If consistent with an approved project, funds may be transferred by the State to a political subdivision or other appropriate public agency. (3) Conversion to other than public outdoor recreation use .—No property acquired or developed with assistance under this section shall, without the approval of the Secretary, be converted to other than public outdoor recreation use. The Secretary shall approve a conversion only if the Secretary finds it to be in accordance with the then-existing comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan and only on such conditions as the Secretary considers necessary to ensure the substitution of other recreation properties of at least equal fair market value and of reasonably equivalent usefulness and location. Wetland areas and interests therein as identified in the wetlands provisions of the comprehensive plan and proposed to be acquired as suitable replacement property within the same State that is otherwise acceptable to the Secretary, acting through the Director, shall be deemed to be of reasonably equivalent usefulness with the property proposed for conversion. (4) Reports and accounting procedures .—No payment shall be made to any State until the State has agreed to— (A) provide such reports to the Secretary in such form and containing such information as may be reasonably necessary to enable the Secretary to perform the Secretary's duties under this chapter; and (B) provide such fiscal control and fund accounting procedures as may be necessary to ensure proper disbursement and accounting for Federal funds paid to the State under this chapter.",

(2) Consultation .—Prior to making a determination under this subsection, the Secretary shall consult with the governing body of the county, city, town, or other jurisdiction or jurisdictions having primary taxing authority over the land or interest to be acquired as to the impacts of the proposed action. (3) Action to advance local public awareness .—The Secretary shall take such steps as the Secretary considers appropriate to advance local public awareness of the proposed action. (4) Administration of acquisitions .—Land, water, and interests in land or water acquired in accordance with this subsection shall be administered as part of the System unit to which they are added, subject to the laws and regulations applicable to the System unit. (5) When authority applies .—For the purposes of paragraph (1)(A), in all cases except the case of technical boundary changes (resulting from such causes as survey error or changed road alignments), the authority of the Secretary under paragraph (1)(A) shall apply only if each of the following conditions is met: (A) The sum of the total acreage of the land, water, and interests in land or water to be added to the System unit and the total acreage of the land, water, and interests in land or water to be deleted from the System unit is not more than 5 percent of the total Federal acreage authorized to be included in the System unit and is less than 200 acres.

(D) The proposed boundary change is not an element of a more comprehensive boundary change proposal. (E) The proposed boundary has been subject to a public review and comment period. (F) The Director obtains written consent for the boundary change from all property owners whose land, water, or interests in land or water, or a portion of whose land, water, or interests in land or water, will be added to or deleted from the System unit by the boundary change. (G) The land abuts other Federal land administered by the Director.

        "text": "In furtherance of the findings and policy stated in section 101912 of this title, and except as provided by this subchapter or otherwise authorized by law, the Secretary shall utilize concession contracts to authorize a person, corporation, or other entity to provide accommodations, facilities, and services to visitors to System units. Concession contracts shall be awarded as follows: (1) Competitive selection process .—Except as otherwise provided in this section, all proposed concession contracts shall be awarded by the Secretary to the person, corporation, or other entity submitting the best proposal, as determined by the Secretary through a competitive selection process. The competitive process shall include simplified procedures for small, individually-owned entities seeking award of a concession contract. (2) Solicitation of proposals .—Except as otherwise provided in this section, prior to awarding a new concession contract (including renewals or extensions of existing concession contracts) the Secretary— (A) shall publicly solicit proposals for the concession contract; and (B) in connection with the solicitation, shall— (i) prepare a prospectus and publish notice of its availability at least once in local or national newspapers or trade publications, by electronic means, or both, as appropriate; and (ii) make the prospectus available on request to all interested persons. (3) Information to be included in prospectus .—The prospectus shall include the following information: (A) The minimum requirements for the contract as set forth in paragraph (4). (B) The terms and conditions of any existing concession contract relating to the services and facilities to be provided, including all fees and other forms of compensation provided to the United States by the concessioner. (C) Other authorized facilities or services that may be provided in a proposal. (D) Facilities and services to be provided by the Secretary to the concessioner, including public access, utilities, and buildings. (E) An estimate of the amount of compensation due an existing concessioner from a new concessioner under the terms of a prior concession contract. (F) A statement as to the weight to be given to each selection factor identified in the prospectus and the relative importance of those factors in the selection process. (G) Other information related to the proposed concession operation that is provided to the Secretary pursuant to a concession contract or is otherwise available to the Secretary, as the Secretary determines is necessary to allow for the submission of competitive proposals. (H) Where applicable, a description of a preferential right to the renewal of the proposed concession contract held by an existing concessioner as set forth in paragraph (7). (4) Consideration of proposals.— (A) Minimum requirements .—No proposal shall be considered that fails to meet the minimum requirements as determined by the Secretary. The minimum requirements shall include the following: (i) The minimum acceptable franchise fee or other forms of consideration to the Federal Government. (ii) Any facilities, services, or capital investment required to be provided by the concessioner. (iii) Measures necessary to ensure the protection, conservation, and preservation of resources of the System unit. (B) Rejection of proposal .—The Secretary shall reject any proposal, regardless of the franchise fee offered, if the Secretary determines that— (i) the person, corporation, or entity is not qualified or is not likely to provide satisfactory service; or (ii) the proposal is not responsive to the objectives of protecting and preserving resources of the System unit and of providing necessary and appropriate facilities and services to the public at reasonable rates. (C) All proposals fail to meet mimimum 1 requirements or are rejected .—If all proposals submitted to the Secretary fail to meet the minimum requirements or are rejected by the Secretary, the Secretary shall establish new minimum contract requirements and re-initiate the competitive selection process pursuant to this section. (D) Terms and conditions materially amended or not incorporated in contract .—The Secretary may not execute a concession contract that materially amends or does not incorporate the proposed terms and conditions of the concession contract as set forth in the applicable prospectus. If proposed material amendments or changes are considered appropriate by the Secretary, the Secretary shall resolicit offers for the concession contract incorporating the material amendments or changes. (5) Selection of the best proposal.— (A) Factors in selection .—In selecting the best proposal, the Secretary shall consider the following principal factors: (i) The responsiveness of the proposal to the objectives of protecting, conserving, and preserving resources of the System unit and of providing necessary and appropriate facilities and services to the public at reasonable rates. (ii) The experience and related background of the person, corporation, or entity submitting the proposal, including the past performance and expertise of the person, corporation or entity in providing the same or similar facilities or services. (iii) The financial capability of the person, corporation, or entity submitting the proposal. (iv) The proposed franchise fee, except that consideration of revenue to the United States shall be subordinate to the objectives of protecting, conserving, and preserving resources of the System unit and of providing necessary and appropriate facilities to the public at reasonable rates. (B) Secondary factors .—The Secretary may also consider such secondary factors as the Secretary considers appropriate. (C) Development of regulations .—In developing regulations to implement this subchapter, the Secretary shall consider the extent to which plans for employment of Indians (including Native Alaskans) and involvement of businesses owned by Indians, Indian tribes, or Native Alaskans in the operation of a concession contract should be identified as a factor in the selection of a best proposal under this section. (6) Congressional notification.— (A) In general .—The Secretary shall submit any proposed concession contract with anticipated annual gross receipts in excess of $5,000,000 or a duration of more than 10 years to the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate. (B) Waiting period .—The Secretary shall not award any proposed concession contract to which subparagraph (A) applies until at least 60 days subsequent to the notification of both Committees. (7) Preferential right of renewal.— (A) In general .—Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall not grant a concessioner a preferential right to renew a concession contract, or any other form of preference to a concession contract. (B) Exception .—The Secretary shall grant a preferential right of renewal to an existing concessioner with respect to proposed renewals of the categories of concession contracts described by paragraph (8), subject to the requirements of that paragraph. (C) Entitlement to award of new contract .—A concessioner that successfully exercises a preferential right of renewal in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter shall be entitled to award of the proposed new concession contract to which the preference applies. (8) Outfitter and guide services and small contracts.— (A) Application .—Paragraph (7) shall apply only to the following: (i) Subject to subparagraph (B), concession contracts that solely authorize the provision of specialized backcountry outdoor recreation guide services that require the employment of specially trained and experienced guides to accompany System unit visitors in the backcountry so as to provide a safe and enjoyable experience for visitors who otherwise may not have the skills and equipment to engage in that activity. (ii) Subject to subparagraph (C), concession contracts with anticipated annual gross receipts under $500,000. (B) Outfitting and guide concessioners.— (i) Description .—Outfitting and guide concessioners, where otherwise qualified, include concessioners that provide guided river running, hunting, fishing, horseback, camping, and mountaineering experiences. (ii) When entitled to preferential right .—An outfitting and guide concessioner is entitled to a preferential right of renewal under this subchapter only if— (I) the contract with the outfitting and guide concessioner does not grant the concessioner any interest, including any leasehold surrender interest or possessory interest, in capital improvements on land owned by the United States within a System unit, other than a capital improvement constructed by a concessioner pursuant to the terms of a concession contract prior to November 13, 1998, or constructed or owned by a concessioner or the concessioner's predecessor before the subject land was incorporated into the System; (II) the Secretary determines that the concessioner has operated satisfactorily during the term of the contract (including any extension); and (III) the concessioner has submitted a responsive proposal for a proposed new concession contract that satisfies the minimum requirements established by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (4). (C) Contract with estimated gross receipts of less than $500,000 .—A concessioner that holds a concession contract that the Secretary estimates will result in gross annual receipts of less than $500,000 if renewed shall be entitled to a preferential right of renewal under this subchapter if— (i) the Secretary has determined that the concessioner has operated satisfactorily during the term of the contract (including any extension); and (ii) the concessioner has submitted a responsive proposal for a proposed new concession contract that satisfies the minimum requirements established by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (4). (9) New or additional services .—The Secretary may propose to amend the applicable terms of an existing concessions contract to provide new and additional services where the Secretary determines the services are necessary and appropriate for public use and enjoyment of the unit of the National Park System in which they are located and are consistent to the highest practicable degree with the preservation and conservation of the resources and values of the unit. Such new and additional services shall not represent a material change to the required and authorized services as set forth in the applicable prospectus or contract. (10) Authority of secretary not limited .—Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as limiting the authority of the Secretary to determine whether to issue a concession contract or to establish its terms and conditions in furtherance of the policies expressed in this subchapter. (11) Exceptions .—Notwithstanding this section, the Secretary may award, without public solicitation, the following: (A) Temporary contract .—To avoid interruption of services to the public at a System unit, the Secretary may award a temporary concession contract or an extension of an existing concessions contract for a term not to exceed 3 years, except that prior to making the award, the Secretary shall take all reasonable and appropriate steps to consider alternatives to avoid the interruption. (B) Contract in extraordinary circumstances .—The Secretary may award a concession contract in extraordinary circumstances where compelling and equitable considerations require the award of a concession contract to a particular party in the public interest. Award of a concession contract under this subparagraph shall not be made by the Secretary until at least 30 days after— (i) publication in the Federal Register of notice of the Secretary's intention to award the contract and the reasons for the action; and (ii) submission of notice to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives. \\n\\n| Revised Section | Source (U.S. Code) | Source (Statutes at Large) |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| 101913 | 16 U.S.C. 5952 (less (7)(C)). | Pub.

        "text": "(b) Leasehold Surrender Interest in Capital Improvements .—A concessioner that constructs a capital improvement on land owned by the United States within a System unit pursuant to a concession contract shall have a leasehold surrender interest in the capital improvement subject to the following terms and conditions: (1) In general .—A concessioner shall have a leasehold surrender interest in each capital improvement constructed by a concessioner under a concession contract, consisting solely of a right to compensation for the capital improvement to the extent of the value of the concessioner's leasehold surrender interest in the capital improvement. (2) Pledge as security .—A leasehold surrender interest may be pledged as security for financing of a capital improvement or the acquisition of a concession contract when approved by the Secretary pursuant to this subchapter. (3) Transfer and relinquishment or waiver of interest .—A leasehold surrender interest shall be transferred by the concessioner in connection with any transfer of the concession contract and may be relinquished or waived by the concessioner. (4) Limit on extinguishing or taking interest .—A leasehold surrender interest shall not be extinguished by the expiration or other termination of a concession contract and may not be taken for public use except on payment of just compensation. (5) Value of interest .—The value of a leasehold surrender interest in a capital improvement shall be an amount equal to the initial value (construction cost of the capital improvement), increased (or decreased) by the same percentage increase (or decrease) as the percentage increase (or decrease) in the Consumer Price Index, from the date of making the investment in the capital improvement by the concessioner to the date of payment of the value of the leasehold surrender interest, less depreciation of the capital improvement as evidenced by the condition and prospective serviceability in comparison with a new unit of like kind. (6) Value of interest in certain new concession contracts.— (A) How value is determined .—The Secretary may provide, in any new concession contract that the Secretary estimates will have a leasehold surrender interest of more than $10,000,000, that the value of any leasehold surrender interest in a capital improvement shall be based on— (i) a reduction on an annual basis, in equal portions, over the same number of years as the time period associated with the straight line depreciation of the initial value (construction cost of the capital improvement), as provided by applicable Federal income tax laws and regulations in effect on November 12, 1998; or (ii) an alternative formula that is consistent with the objectives of this subchapter. (B) When alternative formula may be used .—The Secretary may use an alternative formula under subparagraph (A)(ii) only if the Secretary determines, after scrutiny of the financial and other circumstances involved in the particular concession contract (including providing notice in the Federal Register and opportunity for comment), that the alternative formula is, compared to the standard method of determining value provided for in paragraph (5), necessary to provide a fair return to the Federal Government and to foster competition for the new contract by providing a reasonable opportunity to make a profit under the new contract. If no responsive offers are received in response to a solicitation that includes the alternative formula, the concession opportunity shall be resolicited with the leasehold surrender interest value as described in paragraph (5). (7) Increase in value of interest .—Where a concessioner, pursuant to the terms of a concession contract, makes a capital improvement to an existing capital improvement in which the concessioner has a leasehold surrender interest, the cost of the additional capital improvement shall be added to the then-current value of the concessioner's leasehold surrender interest.",

Where that possessory interest is not described in the existing concession contract, compensation of possessory interest shall be determined in accordance with the laws in effect on November 12, 1998. (2) Existing concessioner awarded a new contract .—A concessioner awarded a new concession contract to replace an existing concession contract after November 13, 1998, instead of directly receiving the possessory interest compensation, shall have a leasehold surrender interest in its existing possessory interest improvements under the terms of the new concession contract and shall carry over as the initial value of the leasehold surrender interest (instead of construction cost) an amount equal to the value of the existing possessory interest as of the termination date of the previous concession contract. In the event of a dispute between the concessioner and the Secretary as to the value of the possessory interest, the matter shall be resolved through binding arbitration. (3) New concessioner awarded a contract .—A new concessioner awarded a concession contract and required to pay a prior concessioner for possessory interest in prior improvements shall have a leasehold surrender interest in the prior improvements. The initial value in the leasehold surrender interest (instead of construction cost) shall be an amount equal to the value of the existing possessory interest as of the termination date of the previous concession contract. (4) De novo review of value determination .—If the Secretary, or either party to a value determination proceeding conducted under a Service concession contract issued before November 13, 1998, considers that the value determination decision issued pursuant to the proceeding misinterprets or misapplies relevant contractual requirements or their underlying legal authority, the Secretary or either party may seek, within 180 days after the date of the decision, de novo review of the value determination decision by the United States Court of Federal Claims. The Court of Federal Claims may make an order affirming, vacating, modifying or correcting the determination decision.",

(2) At any time, the remaining appropriation shall be apportioned on the basis of need to individual States by the Secretary in such amounts as in the Secretary's judgment will best accomplish the purposes of this chapter. The determination of need shall include consideration of— (A) the proportion that the population of each State bears to the total population of the United States; (B) the use of outdoor recreation resources of each State by persons from outside the State; and (C) the Federal resources and programs in each State. (3) The total allocation to a State under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not exceed 10 percent of the total amount allocated to all of the States in any one year. (4) The Secretary shall notify each State of its apportionments. The amounts shall be available for payment to the State for planning, acquisition, or development projects as prescribed. Any amount of any apportionment that has not been paid or obligated by the Secretary during the fiscal year in which the notification is given and for 2 fiscal years thereafter shall be reapportioned by the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (2) without regard to the 10 percent limitation to an individual State specified in this subsection.",

The plan shall be adequate if, in the judgment of the Secretary, it encompasses and will promote the purposes of this chapter. No plan shall be approved unless the chief executive official of the State certifies that ample opportunity for public participation in plan development and revision has been accorded. The Secretary shall develop, in consultation with others, criteria for public participation, which criteria shall constitute the basis for the certification by the chief executive official. The plan shall contain— (A) the name of the State agency that will have authority to represent and act for the State in dealing with the Secretary for purposes of this chapter; (B) an evaluation of the demand for and supply of outdoor recreation resources and facilities in the State; (C) a program for the implementation of the plan; and (D) other necessary information, as determined by the Secretary. (2) Factors to be considered .—The plan shall take into account relevant Federal resources and programs and shall be correlated so far as practicable with other State, regional, and local plans. Where there exists or is in preparation for any particular State a comprehensive plan financed in part with funds supplied by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, any statewide outdoor recreation plan prepared for purposes of this part shall be based on the same population, growth, and other pertinent factors as are used in formulating plans financed by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. (3) Provision of assistance when plan not otherwise available or to maintain plan .—The Secretary may provide financial assistance to any State for projects for the preparation of a comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan when the plan is not otherwise available or for the maintenance of the plan. (4) Wetlands .—A comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan shall specifically address wetlands within the State as an important outdoor recreation resource as a prerequisite to approval, except that a revised comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan shall not be required by the Secretary, if a State submits, and the Secretary, acting through the Director, approves, as a part of and as an addendum to the existing comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan, a wetlands priority plan developed in consultation with the State agency with responsibility for fish and wildlife resources and consistent with the national wetlands priority conservation plan developed under section 301 of the Emergency Wetlands Resources Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 3921) or, if the national plan has not been completed, consistent with the provisions of that section.",

(2) Acquisition of land or water.— (A) In general .—Under paragraph (1), the Secretary may provide financial assistance for a project for the acquisition of land, water, or an interest in land or water, or a wetland area or an interest in a wetland area, as identified in the wetlands provisions of the comprehensive plan (other than land, water, or an interest in land or water acquired from the United States for less than fair market value), but not including incidental costs relating to acquisition. (B) Retention of right of use and occupancy .—When a State provides that the owner of a single-family residence may, at the owner's option, elect to retain a right of use and occupancy for not less than 6 months after the date of acquisition of the residence and the owner elects to retain such a right— (i) the owner shall be deemed to have waived any benefits under sections 203 to 206 of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 4623 to 4626); and (ii) for the purposes of those sections the owner shall not be deemed to be a displaced person as defined in section 101 of that Act (42 U.S.C. 4601). (3) Development of basic outdoor recreation facilities .—Under paragraph (1), the Secretary may provide financial assistance for a project for development of basic outdoor recreation facilities to serve the general public, including the development of Federal land under lease to States for terms of 25 years or more. No assistance shall be available under this chapter to enclose or shelter a facility normally used for an outdoor recreation activity, but the Secretary may permit local funding, not to exceed 10 percent of the total amount allocated to a State in any one year, to be used for construction of a sheltered facility for a swimming pool or ice skating rink in an area where the Secretary determines that the construction is justified by the severity of climatic conditions and the increased public use made possible by the construction.",

The Secretary may make payments from time to time in keeping with the rate of progress toward the satisfactory completion of a project. The approval of all projects and all payments, or any commitments relating thereto, shall be withheld until the Secretary receives appropriate written assurance from the State that the State has the ability and intention to finance its share of the cost of all of the projects, and to operate and maintain by acceptable standards, at State expense, the properties or facilities acquired or developed for public outdoor recreation use. (2) Payment recipients .—Payments for all projects shall be made by the Secretary to the chief executive official of the State or to a State official or agency designated by the chief executive official or by State law having authority and responsibility to accept and to administer funds paid under this section for approved projects. If consistent with an approved project, funds may be transferred by the State to a political subdivision or other appropriate public agency. (3) Conversion to other than public outdoor recreation use .—No property acquired or developed with assistance under this section shall, without the approval of the Secretary, be converted to other than public outdoor recreation use. The Secretary shall approve a conversion only if the Secretary finds it to be in accordance with the then-existing comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan and only on such conditions as the Secretary considers necessary to ensure the substitution of other recreation properties of at least equal fair market value and of reasonably equivalent usefulness and location. Wetland areas and interests therein as identified in the wetlands provisions of the comprehensive plan and proposed to be acquired as suitable replacement property within the same State that is otherwise acceptable to the Secretary, acting through the Director, shall be deemed to be of reasonably equivalent usefulness with the property proposed for conversion. (4) Reports and accounting procedures .—No payment shall be made to any State until the State has agreed to— (A) provide such reports to the Secretary in such form and containing such information as may be reasonably necessary to enable the Secretary to perform the Secretary's duties under this chapter; and (B) provide such fiscal control and fund accounting procedures as may be necessary to ensure proper disbursement and accounting for Federal funds paid to the State under this chapter.",

During an initial interim period to be established by regulations under this chapter, this requirement may be satisfied by local government submissions of preliminary action programs that briefly define objectives, priorities, and implementation strategies for overall system recovery and maintenance and commit the applicant to a scheduled program development process. Following this interim period, all local applicants shall submit to the Secretary, as a condition of eligibility, a 5-year action program for park and recreation recovery that satisfactorily demonstrates— (1) systematic identification of recovery objectives, priorities, and implementation strategies; (2) adequate planning for rehabilitation of specific recreation areas and facilities, including projections of the cost of proposed projects; (3) the capacity and commitment to ensure that facilities provided or improved under this chapter shall continue to be adequately maintained, protected, staffed, and supervised; (4) the intention to maintain total local public outlays for park and recreation purposes at levels at least equal to those in the year preceding that in which grant assistance is sought except in any case where a reduction in park and recreation outlays is proportionate to a reduction in overall spending by the applicant; and (5) the relationship of the park and recreation recovery program to overall community development and urban revitalization efforts.",
